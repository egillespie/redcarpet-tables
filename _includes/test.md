1. Do something.

2. Do something else.

    1. If the reverse-Pi separation gauge is set to `OFF` you can follow
       the following procedure.

        1. Use the flux capacitor on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, but
           only if you have not done so already.

        2. Do not use the flux capacitor if it's raining, because the
            universe will implode.

    2. If the reverse-Pi separation gauge is set to `ON` then you
       should follow Procedure 42.

3. Go back to doing things.
